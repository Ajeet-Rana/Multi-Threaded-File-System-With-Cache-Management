# Multi-Threaded File System Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture of the Multi-Threaded File System (MTFS). The system is designed to provide efficient, thread-safe file operations with integrated caching and journaling capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. File System Core (`fs/`)

- Implements core file system operations (read, write, create, delete)
- Manages file metadata and directory structure
- Coordinates between other components
- Thread-safe operation handling

### 2. Cache System (`cache/`)

- LRU-based caching mechanism
- Thread-safe cache operations
- Configurable cache size and eviction policies
- Cache coherency management

### 3. Storage Manager (`storage/`)

- Low-level block device operations
- Block allocation and deallocation
- Disk space management
- Direct I/O operations

### 4. Thread Management (`threading/`)

- Thread pool implementation
- Synchronization primitives
- Lock management
- Task scheduling

### 5. Command Line Interface (`cli/`)

- User interaction layer
- Command parsing and execution
- Interactive and batch mode support
- Error reporting

### 6. Journaling System (`journal/`)

- Transaction logging
- Crash recovery
- Atomic operations
- Consistency maintenance

### 7. Common Utilities (`common/`)

- Logging framework
- Error handling
- Configuration management
- Common data structures

## Data Flow

1. User request → CLI
2. CLI → File System Core
3. File System Core → Cache (check if data present)
4. Cache miss → Storage Manager
5. All operations logged by Journal
6. Errors handled by Common utilities

## Threading Model

- Each operation runs in its own thread from the thread pool
- Read operations can run concurrently
- Write operations are serialized per file
- Global operations (format, mount) are fully serialized

## Error Handling

1. All errors are logged
2. Exceptions propagate up to CLI
3. Recovery procedures for each error type
4. Automatic retry for transient failures

## Performance Considerations

1. Cache hit rate optimization
2. Minimizing lock contention
3. Efficient block allocation
4. Batch operations where possible

## Security

1. File permissions
2. Access control
3. Data integrity checks
4. Secure error handling

## Future Improvements

1. Distributed operation support
2. Enhanced caching strategies
3. Compression support
4. Network file system interface

## Development Guidelines

1. All public APIs must be thread-safe
2. Use RAII for resource management
3. Document all public interfaces
4. Write unit tests for new features
5. Benchmark performance-critical code

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for each component
2. Integration tests for component interaction
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Stress testing
5. Recovery testing
